# Homework Four

The goal of this assignement was to take the travel fly website's first page (homework 3) and make all elements on the page responsive. This includes making the widths of certain items responsive, and making some elemnts snap to new positions (adaptive). The main elements that needed to be updated were the three travel plan boxes which are now oriented vertically, and the form which is also oriented vertically.
